## What this project is about
This game was made during Codaisseur's Bootcamp on week 7 to use the techniques that we learned during 6 weeks. This game uses signup and login functionality to track players. We use a token-based login system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

The game supports multiple simultaneous games with a lobby system. For the backend of this project, check out [this](https://github.com/Panthari-Panthong/dice-game-server) repository.
